## Putting it Together ## 
First, pick a network architecture; choose the layout of your neural network, including how many hidden units in each layer and how many layers in total you want to have.

1)Number of input units = dimension of features x^{(i)}x(i)
2) Number of output units = number of classes
3) Number of hidden units per layer = usually more the better (must balance with cost of computation as it increases with more hidden units)
4) Defaults: 1 hidden layer. If you have more than 1 hidden layer, then it is recommended that you have the same number of units in every hidden layer.
