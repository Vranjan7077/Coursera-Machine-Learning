## Putting it Together ## 
First, pick a network architecture; choose the layout of your neural network, including how many hidden units in each layer and how many layers in total you want to have.

1)Number of input units = dimension of features x^{(i)}x(i) <br/>
2) Number of output units = number of classes <br/>
3) Number of hidden units per layer = usually more the better (must balance with cost of computation as it increases with more hidden units) <br/>
4) Defaults: 1 hidden layer. If you have more than 1 hidden layer, then it is recommended that you have the same number of units in every hidden layer.

The following image gives us an intuition of what is happening as we are implementing our neural network:
