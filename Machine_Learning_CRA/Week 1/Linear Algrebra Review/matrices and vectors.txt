Matrices and Vectors

Matrices are 2-dimensional arrays:

\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \newline d & e & f \newline g & h & i \newline j & k & l\end{bmatrix}
The above matrix has four rows and three columns, so it is a 4 x 3 matrix.

A vector is a matrix with one column and many rows:

\begin{bmatrix} w \newline x \newline y \newline z \end{bmatrix}
So vectors are a subset of matrices. The above vector is a 4 x 1 matrix.

Notation and terms:

A_{ij}A 
ij
?	  refers to the element in the ith row and jth column of matrix A.
A vector with 'n' rows is referred to as an 'n'-dimensional vector.
v_iv 
i
?	  refers to the element in the ith row of the vector.
In general, all our vectors and matrices will be 1-indexed. Note that for some programming languages, the arrays are 0-indexed.
Matrices are usually denoted by uppercase names while vectors are lowercase.
"Scalar" means that an object is a single value, not a vector or matrix.
\mathbb{R} refers to the set of scalar real numbers.
\mathbb{R^n} refers to the set of n-dimensional vectors of real numbers.
